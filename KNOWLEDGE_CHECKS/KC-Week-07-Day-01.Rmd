## In-class practice

+ In groups, do a down-the-line proof for the derivation of $\hat{p} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n X_i}{n}$ as the MLE of the proportion $p$. See Example 1-1

## Knowledge Check

+ Suppose that for a random sample $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$, each $X_i$ has pdf $f(x_i; \theta)$, where $\theta$ is an unknown parameter that the pdf depends on (e.g. $\mu$ or $\sigma^2$). Explain what is meant by each piece of the following and how to get from one expression to the next:

$$L(\theta) = P(X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, ... X_n = x_n) = f(x_1; \theta)\cdot f(x_2;\theta)\cdots f(x_n; \theta) = \prod_{i = 1}^nf(x_i;\theta)$$
+ What are the key features of a Bernoulli random variable?
+ What is the pdf of a Bernoulli random variable?
+ What is the pdf of a normal random variable? 
+ In a normal distribution, what notation do we typically use for the parameters $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$?
