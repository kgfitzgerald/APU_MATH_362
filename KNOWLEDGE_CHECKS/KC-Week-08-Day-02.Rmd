## Student Questions

+ Book: "Because we know that if the correlation coefficient is 0, then $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables"
    + You're correct that this is wrong! 
+ What is MSE and what does it do?

$$MSE = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2}{n-2}$$

+ Why does the test statistic have $n-2$ degrees of freedom instead of $n-1$
$$T = \frac{\hat{\beta} - \beta}{\sqrt{\frac{MSE}{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}}$$

+ Why is that ^^ the test statistic?
+ Why would we want to test $H_0: \beta = \beta_0$
+ What R code do we use to get the regression/hypothesis test output?

## PS 08 - work on the board!
