1. Describe what each symbol in $\chi^2 = \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma_0^2}$ means, and how this expression is used in a hypothesis test. 

1. How is $\chi^2$ above distributed? 

1. Assume you're conducting a one-sided hypothesis test for $\sigma^2$ with a sample size of 50. What should you set your $\chi^2$ cutoff value to be if you want to: 

    a) control Type I error rate to be 0.10
    a) control Type I error rate to be 0.05
    a) control Type I error rate to be 0.01

1. Describe how the above cutoff values would change if you instead had a sample size of 100. You don't actually need to compute new values.

1. If $U \sim \chi^2_{n-1}$ and $V \sim \chi^2_{m-1}$, how is $\frac{U/(n-1)}{V/(m-1)}$ distributed?

1. Explain why the test statistic for the hypothesis test $H_0: \sigma^2_X = \sigma^2_Y$ is $F = \frac{S_X^2}{S_Y^2}$ and not $F = \frac{S_X^2}{S_Y^2}\frac{\sigma_Y^2}{\sigma_X^2}$.

1. How many parameters does the F distribution have? 

1. Describe what each symbol in $F_{1 - \alpha/2}(n-1, m-1)$ stands for, and how this expression is used in a hypothesis test.

1. Assume you're conducting a one-sided hypothesis test for $\sigma_X^2 = \sigma_Y^2$ with a sample size of n_X = n_Y = 50. What should you set your $F$ cutoff value to be if you want to: 

    a) control Type I error rate to be 0.10
    a) control Type I error rate to be 0.05
    a) control Type I error rate to be 0.01
