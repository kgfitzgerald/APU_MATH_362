You may find it useful to have your notes and/or textbook from MATH 361 handy as you read these sections. In particular, remind yourself of the pdf of a Bernoulli random variable, and the pdf of a normal random variable. 

If you didn't keep access to the HTZ textbook for this semester, [Penn State's STAT 414 course](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat414/) is very similar to our MATH 361 course and is a good reference (your reading annotations have all come from PSU's STAT 415 course, which is similar to our MATH 362). 

Some context for what you will read this week: so far we have taken for granted that $\overline{X}$ and $\hat{p}$ are "good" estimates of $\mu$ and $p$. Here, we will define what we mean by "good", and will learn how the formulas for estimators such as $\overline{X}$ and $\hat{p}$ are derived.
