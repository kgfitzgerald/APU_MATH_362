## Knowledge Check

+ Mathematically, what does it mean for an estimator to be unbiased?
+ Recall properties of expected value. How can you re-write/reduce the following, where $a$ and $b$ are constants?
    + $E(aX)$
    + $E(aX + b)$
    + $E(\sum_{i = 1}^naX_i)$
    + $E[\sum_{i = 1}^n(aX_i + b)]$
    
## In-class practice

+ In groups, do down-the-line proofs to show that when $X_i \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$:
    + The MLE of $\mu$ is unbiased
    + The MLE of $\sigma^2$ is biased
    + The usual sample variance $S^2$ is an unbiased estimator for $\sigma^2$
