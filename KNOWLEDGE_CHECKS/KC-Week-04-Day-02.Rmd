# Reading Annotation Q/A


+ How does using the variable $D_i$ get rid of the dependence between $X_i$ and $Y_i$ in paired data?


# Knowledge Check

1. Describe what each symbol in $t = \frac{\bar{d} - \mu_0}{s_D/\sqrt{n}}$ stands for, and how this expression is used in a hypothesis test.

1. What is the distribution of $t$ as defined above?

1. What is the distribution of $\bar{d}$?

1. What's the difference between a pooled two-sample t-test and Welch's t-test? When should you use one vs. the other? 

1. Describe what each symbol in $|t| \geq t_{\alpha/2, n + m -2}$ means, and how this expression is used in a hypothesis test.
