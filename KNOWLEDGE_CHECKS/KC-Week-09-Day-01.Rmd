## Student Questions


## Knowledge Check

+ When $Z \sim N(0,1)$, how is $Q = Z^2$ distributed?
+ For chi-square tests, what does a large value of $Q_1$ indicate? 
+ Articulate what is going on in the following formula and what is meant by "OBSERVED" and "EXPECTED":
$$Q_1 = \sum_{i = 1}^2\frac{(Y_i - np_i)^2}{np_i} = \sum_{i = 1}^2\frac{(\text{OBSERVED - EXPECTED})^2}{\text{EXPECTED}}$$

+ How many degrees of freedom does $Q_1$ have?
+ What is the relationship between a Z-test for a proportion and a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test?
