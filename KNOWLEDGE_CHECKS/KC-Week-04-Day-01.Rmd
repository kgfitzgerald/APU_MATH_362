```

1. Draw a picture that illustrates what a p-value is. Make sure to include adequate labels for $\alpha$, the center of the distribution, and the critical value. 

2. Describe how a p-value is used to define a critical/rejection region.

3. Describe how to use a p-value and an $\alpha$ level to make a decision about a hypothesis test.

4. Describe what each symbol in $Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}}$ stands for.

5. What is the difference between $p$, $p_0$, and a p-value in the context of a hypothesis test about a proportion? 

6. Articulate what's going on with the two x-axes in the following figure.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/z-phat-dist.png")
```

7. Describe how $\alpha$ and Type I error are related. 

8. Assume you're conducting a two-sided hypothesis test. What should you set your Z cutoff value to be if you want to: 

    a) control Type I error rate to be 0.10
    a) control Type I error rate to be 0.05
    a) control Type I error rate to be 0.01
